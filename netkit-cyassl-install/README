=== NETKIT LAB INSTALL PROCESS ===

WARNING - This lab is solely intended to be run ONCE after the Filesystem compilation and BEFORE any other lab. 

This lab performs the last preparation steps that cannot be executed during the compilation of the Filesystem,
such as the CyaSSL configuration and compilation. This is why the base filesystem is directly mounted, instead
of using the traditional CoW mode of Netkit!
